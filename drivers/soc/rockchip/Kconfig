	help
	  The General Register Files are a central component providing
	  special additional settings registers for a lot of soc-components.
	  In a lot of cases there also need to be default settings initialized
	  to make some of them conform to expectations of the kernel.

	help
	  Say y here to enable support io domains on Rockchip SoCs. It is
	  necessary for the io domain setting of the SoC to match the
	  voltage supplied by the regulators.

	help
	  Describe the hierarchy for the Dynamic Thermal Power Management tree
	  on this platform. That will create all the power capping capable
	  devices.

	help
	  Some Rockchip SoCs, such as the RK3576, use a PWM controller that has
	  several different functions, such as generating PWM waveforms but also
	  counting waveforms.

	  This driver manages the overall device, and selects between different
	  functionalities at runtime as needed, with drivers for them
	  implemented in their respective subsystems.
